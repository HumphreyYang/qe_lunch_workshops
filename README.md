# qe_lunch_workshops



The QuantEcon lunch workshops are specified with the following three tables:

- Table 1 schedules the topic(s), speaker(s), date and venue for the seminar in ``week_xx``,
- Table 2 lists volunteer speakers, and
- Table 3 shows potential topics of interest.

All presentation materials corresponding to ``week_xx`` under the column ``Week No.`` of Table 1 are stored in the same name folder above (there will be separate sub-folders after their names inside the folder ``week_xx`` if there is over one speaker).

If you are interested in **becoming a volunteer speaker** or **hearing some topic** in the coming workshops, then do not hesitate to contact Shu Hu by email ([shu.hu@anu.edu.au](mailto:shu.hu@anu.edu.au)).
